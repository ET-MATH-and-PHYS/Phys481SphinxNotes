**Daily Tasks**
===============

**September 7th (Lecture 1)**
-----------------------------

Formed the group for assignment 1 consisting of Abby Swadling, Elijah Thompson, Gabby Gelinas, and Taylor Cey. We divided the tasks with Gabby and Abby completing question 1, Taylor completing questions 2 and 6, Elijah completing question 3 and the intro and conclusion, Gabby completing question 4, and Abby completing question 5.

Most tasks were completed, with formatting and the intro and conclusion left unfinished.


**September 9th (Lecture 2)**
-----------------------------

All team members finished their remaining tasks, and formatting of the report was finalized. Additionally, team members worked together to set up their respective Sphinx documents.


**September 14th (Lecture 3)**
------------------------------

Members began reading through the document for assignment 2, as well as bouncing ideas around for different ways to solve the given questions.


**September 16th (Lecture 4)**
------------------------------

Got clarifications for questions on assignment 2, and most group members finished all questions except for question 6.


**September 21th (Lecture 5)**
------------------------------

Continued working on cleaning up final parts for assignment 2, while asking for clarification on problems 3 and 4.


**September 23th (Lecture 6)**
------------------------------

Finished organizing the report, and decided how we wanted to introduction and conclusion to look.


**September 28th (Lecture 7)**
------------------------------

Tasks were delegated for Assignment 3, Automata and Life, and members began with reading the notebook along with appropriate wikipedia articles.


**October 5th (Lecture 8)**
---------------------------

Group members continued with their respective tasks in the Automata and Life assignment, while questions were asked about the appropriate methods for calculating means, standard deviations, and uncertanties.


**October 7th (Lecture 9)**
---------------------------
As members finished their tasks, delagations of who would put together the report, who would write the introduction, and who would write the conclusion were made.


**October 12th (Lecture 10)**
-----------------------------

Members began reading and working through the notes for the Ising model, as ideas were shared for how to distribute the work.


**October 14th (Lecture 11)**
-----------------------------

Implementation of the configurations for collections of dipoles was mostly completed, and members worked together to understand the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.

**October 19th (Lecture 12)**
-----------------------------

The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm was finished being implemented, and members moved on to producing it in 1D and 2D cases.


**October 21st (Lecture 13)**
-----------------------------

Members worked together to finish the implementation of the 2D case, and the work for the report was divided between the four members evenly.


**October 26th (Lecture 14)**
-----------------------------

Final changes to the report formatting were made before submission of the assignment.

**October 28th (Lecture 15)**
-----------------------------

Individual work on the Laplace Equations midterm began, starting off with readings of the finite differences methods, matrix methods, and the implementations of the relaxation method.


**November 2nd (Lecture 16)**
-----------------------------

Work on the first two tasks were finished, and the brainstorming for the third task began. At first two implementations were attempted, one using cartesian and one using polar coordinates.


**November 4th (Lecture 17)**
-----------------------------

It was determined that the attempts at task 3 with the relaxation method were producing results with small consistent differences to the theoretical value for task 3.2. Consequently, the approach was shifted to the matrix methods using the symmetry of the boundary conditions to reduce the problem from a 2-dimensional one to a 1-dimenional one in polar coordinates.
